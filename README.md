// Pokedex with search-textbox and individual stat-pages //

To-Do:

- index.js Line 44: Move hard coded CSS to .css files

- fix next-button being infinitely pressable

- more pokemon info
    - weight, size, types(!) etc.

- page doesn't save last state
    -> add local storage

- design
    - fonts
    - top panel for index.html

- make clicking on the image in pokemon.html play the sound

- optional:
    - make pressing next jump to top of the page
    - put another set of buttons above the pokemon list
    - fix pokeball animation being too far up in the mobile/narrow view




Hurdles/Problems:

- tried fetching API like "lazy-loading"
    - problem: had to fetch complete Pokemon list for filtering

- handling the API Data took too much time
    not enough experience
    lots of debugging

- animating the stat bars in pokemon.html was a challenge
